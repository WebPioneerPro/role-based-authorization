# Role Based Authorization Project

## Description

This project is a Role Based Authorization system built using Angular and JSON Server. Users can sign up and log in, but new accounts require admin approval before they can log in. Admins have access to manage user details, while non-admin users do not have access to the Manage Users page. The project is divided into various subcomponents, uses routing and guards for navigation and security, and is fully responsive.
